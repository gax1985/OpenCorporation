## The Agora


In the Classical sense, the Agora was an area of the city where citizens would congregate and discuss all soerts of topics from their lives. It was an ideal place for entrepreneurs to market their wares, gain insight on the best business practices, and interact with their audience. The Agora as a place was associated with social interactions and business ventures, so their audience would be very perceptive. Ofcourse, this would depend on the entrepreneur's creativity!


This brings us, dearest reader, to the portion of the project that is dedicated to ... communication!


In the corporate world, communication is an essential fact of an organization's success strategy. Avenues of communication are expected to be availlable to all. The interface of a communications application should be intuitive, as an overly-complex application would cause the organization to dedicate more precious time towards training their staff on the program. There is a common saying in the business world that spells the following : 


    "Time is Money!"


In the mentioned example, time that would have been spent on training the staff on other critical applications would be wasted on this application, thus costing the organization time and capital. 

In contrast, an intuitive application leverages our own intuition in navigating the user experience. If I was a representative of a software development firm who made it, this would be my key-selling point. Although, another selling point that would be hard to beat would be : 

    "a Free and Open-Source Communications Application!"


If the application itself is free of cost, then organizations would choose the free application if it could fulfill the organization's requirements, as long as it does not conflict with the other software that the organization uses daily. From an open-source perspective, the term "free" is from "freedom", which means that the source code of the application is available to all to see, modify and share for their purposes. This leads to a future where software is in a state of constant flux, where individuals from all around the world would contribute to its improvement, and corporations already reap the rewards from the open-source movement's initiatives!


In the corporate world, I have used Slack personally. It is a fantastic application in my opinion, as it is very expandable and adaptable to the needs of the different organizations that use it. I have examined potential free and open-source alternatives, and the following two options have caught my attention : 


## Matrix Self-Hosted Servers

## Description: 


The Matrix Platform is a self hosted communications platform that is an excellent alternative to Slack. Matrix servers are free of cost, and can be hosted in the cloud, or privately (which is a wonderful gift to OpenCorpation's vision). They are maliable in the sense of their adaptability to a variety of uses. 



## Nextcloud

#### Description : 

Nextcloud is a wonderful free and open-source alternative to the well-known-and-utilized Microsoft Office suite. It provides us with a cloud platform that includes the ability of having file storage, Microsoft-Office compatible document editing, as well as a a large number of plugins to extend its functionality ( one of them being hosting a **Matrix Server**!). As an option, it is tremendously useful. I have utilized it personally, and it has very capable client applications for Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOS.
