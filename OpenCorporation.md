An Open-Source Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, with a focus on **Creativity,**** **Charity** , **Fairness** and **Equality**


## Introduction 


We as human beings have been living for centuries in a socio-economic reality that we have to adapt to. In our working lives, it is rare to obtain the perfect employment opportunity. 

Why is that so ? it could be that the employer is not appreciative of our efforts or knowledge, the wages may not be fair or adequate to live a comfortable life in the person's respective society, the employment position may impact the individual negatively in an emotional basis, with stress, abusive employers , unsafe work conditions ... 


Need I go on? We are living this reality every where on this beautiful , yet slowly decaying earth. We go through our lives with strength and determination that our actions would aid us in improving our lives, and that the grass is cleaner on the other side... 


This is precisely the reason why I wanted to present you, my dearest fellow human beings, with the following picture: 


An aspiring writer located in a third-world country has been gifted with an idea for their debut novel, but does not have the technological means (a Computer) to write the novel, nor the guidance on the best way to manifest this idea into our reality. Our friend does not have any connections to editors, publishers or any legal representatives to aid them on their creative journey. Our friend is physically and mentally exhausted, and is barely coping with life's ever-present challenges...


The writer hears about Open Corporation, would provides means of accomplishing their creative endeavor and honing their writing skill, while providing them with all the possible support that they could possibly get! 


So , what kinds of support do we provide to our fellow human beings? 


## The Dream Job


In our minds, we would each form a concept of the ideal employment position, in which we can support ourselves and our loved ones. It would be something that we love to do, something that has a promise of ascension at some point. It would be a bonus if this employment position provided us with some sort of assistance, such as : 

1. Health-based assistance (usually in the forms of a Health Plan or Drug Plan)
2. Psychological assistance (to deal with the stresses of the employment position, and the struggles of human existence)
3. Legal assistance, which the employee would be eligible for, as long as they follow the regulations of the organization ( in case of any legal issues )
4. Paid Training, in which each of us can learn a new beneficial skill
5. Incentives for excellence, such as a bonus, a promotion , etc.. 


I have personally experienced some of those perks in one of my previous employment positions. I wished that they could be a standard practice in every organization, as the workers for any organization on this beautiful earth are the lifeline of our lives in any society. What unites us all is our humanity, and our creative nature. 


I have been dwelling over this topic for many years. I saw personally the oppression that the workers faced in other regions in the world, as I saw workers working for a wage that does not represent their efforts at all, all while endangering their lives and their wellbeing. I wanted to raise the baseline of what could be possible. I would like us all to be the best that we can be, at the best possible state that we can be in. I wanted us all to have all that they want, need and more ...


First, let us iron out the challenges that stand in our way ...
