## The Core 



The way I see this project is as a group effort by design! 


This project is **Open-Source** by design. The lifeline of this project is *Collaboration*! 


So, how would it work technologically? 


I see this corporation as a group of independant *guilds* of creators, where I will start with the **Writer's Guild** as a starting point ( to draw your creativity and input as well. I am looking at you my dearest fellow *Digital Artists/Animators*, *Musicians*, *Developers* , *Cybersecurity Specialists* and more : D )


The **Decentralized Autonomous Organization** part of this corporation may sound unfamiliar to a lot of us who are not familiar with the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency world, but please allow me to provide you with my understanding of it : 


A corporation where the decisions on certain points or aspects are agreed on by the members of this corporation by a transparent, democratic vote. 


How would it apply in this case? 


I see **Open Corporation** as a living entity that is composed of *creative minds* from all around this beautiful earth, where we can practice caring and charity by design. The corporation would have transaction fees, which are distributed evenly among all the members of the corporation who are participating at the time. A portion of the transaction fees would be distributed to a charity that requires urgent and immediate assistance, a second charity that is focused on environmental issues, and a third charity that is local to where the creator is based ( this is what I would recommend, as other human beings in the world, the planet we inhabit, and our local communities require our urgent assistance). In terms of the wellness portion of this corporation, it would be provided by psychological-aid workers and local medical insurance providers. The patent and copyright-based legal aspects would be contracted to patent/copyright legal practitioners local to the creator's region! In terms of the transaction fee, I was thinking it would be  fitting  to make the transaction fees 1% of the final proceedings of the creative endeavor, so we can flip the current 1% that we have now ; ) 


How can we do so *technologically-speaking* ? I am glad you asked : )
