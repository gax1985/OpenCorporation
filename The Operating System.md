Please permit me to use the **Writer's Guild** as a model for demonstation purposes :



#### The User Experience 


The operating system itself would host the writer's editor for writing their masterpiece,  and at the same time providing the computing power for other writers to write, and aspiring writers to learn the craft!


The way this could be done is with creating a **Docker Cluster** or a **Kubernetes Cluster**. The operating system that the user actually interacts with would contained in a **Docker/Kubernetes Container**!

This formula provides the element of *layering*, in which we would strive to insure everyone's utmost security, and practice effective utilization of computing resources (to cut down on the damage that is done every day to our beautiful planet : ). 

So , to simplify : 


The *hypervisor*  would run *Docker/Kubernetes Containers* which contain the *graphical user interface* that the writer would use to create their work of art!


I have done a lot of research in my aim to find the right graphical user interface for the operating system that is fun to use and light on resources, and I found that the **Linux-based Window Managers** fit the bill, as they are extremely light-weight and *endlessly customizable* ( which would be our bread and butter!)




So to demonstrate : 



##### Hyprland 


I have found the following screenshots on Hyprland's website ([Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)), in which the makers hosted *ricing contests (it refers to the Art of Customizing Window Managers)* :

#### The Operating System (*which runs the User Interface*)



I am really excited to recommend a Linux distribution that is truly mindblowing in its potential, where one can configure the operating system from one file ( or more if more complexity/resourcefulness is desired), save the configuration file, and then install the operating system on another machine and re-create the user experience that they normally use while retaining all the desired applications! 


It helps a *ton* to be able to restore to a previous generation if disaster strikes! Thankfully, NixOS does!


Due to its highly-configurable nature, we can create configurations for operating systems used by the different *guilds*, in which we would work with the creators directly to come up with the best configuration possible for them. Configuration files can be edited as needed, and the changes would be pushed to the desired container on a routine basis. 


The **Operating System** should be prepared in a way that can be run on almost any device out there in the wild. We know that we can not guarantee that it would run, due to the differences in processors, the processor's architecture, the availability of drivers and so on. Since the majority of computer systems are running Microsoft Windows, I thought of starting with the following formulations, as they should be made to provide a wider *availability*. This is followed by other formulations for iOS/iPad devices , MacOS-based systems,  and Android : 

##### 1. A WSL2 Container (for **Microsoft Windows**)

>[!howto]
>
>1. We would create a **NixOS-Based WSL2 Container**. 
>2. In the **WSL2 Container**, we would install [[[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)|Kubernetes]] to it, and configure it that it would be added to the container's configuration file via the steps mentioned in the following link : 
>   [[[Kubernetes - NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Kubernetes)]]

>[!note]
>
>We could install the **Nix Package Manager** to a pre-existing *WSL2 Container* such as an Ubuntu WSL Container , or we can use [[[elitak/nixos-infect: [GPLv3+] install nixos over the existing OS in a DigitalOcean droplet (and others with minor modifications) (github.com)](https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect)|nixos-infect]] to install NixOS on non-NixOS-based systems! 

##### 2. A Bare Metal NixOS-based Distribution


This option would provide the means to run our operating system on bare-metal ( which means it can be installed directly unto a hard-drive, USB Flash Drive) or to run it in a virtual machine. The latter option would be tremendously helpful at the design stage, as we would simulate different configurations ( in terms of virtualized hardware) to mimic realistic usage scenarios ( such as developing the operating system to run on Android devices for example). 

##### 3. A NixOS-based Distribution (running virtually on iPhone/iPad)


Apple's mobile devices would be a bit more challenging, as the only hypervisor that worked on iOS and iPad OS devices is [UTM](https://getutm.app/). Nonetheless,  if we examine the portion of the [Documentation]([iOS | UTM Documentation (getutm.app)](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)) involving the installation of the hypervisor unto an iOS/iPadOS device, the steps are far too daunting for us without the technological know-how and means to jailbreak their device.


##### 4. A NixOS-based Distribution (running virtually on MacOS)


Running the hypervisor on a MacOS-based device would be far easier than its mobile counterparts ( due to the mentioned reasons). 


##### 5. A NixOS-based Distribution (running virtually on Android-based devices)


In terms of running the distribution on an Android device, I have found some promising projects that enable the user to run a virtual machine on Android. Let us go through some of the available options :


  >
>1.  [Andronix](https://andronix.app/)  :
>   
>   
>   ![[Pasted image 20240409042159.png]]
 >  
>This application provides the Android user with the ability to run a virtual machine on the device. They provide custom-made distributions for the users for a premium, but the app itself provides the means to run a virtual machine on the Android device for free!
>
>For more information, check out the project's GitHub page :

>[https://github.com/AndronixApp/AndronixOrigin](https://github.com/AndronixApp/AndronixOrigin)
 >

>2.  [UserLand - Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula&pcampaignid=web_share)  :
>   
>   ![[Pasted image 20240409043958.png]]
 >  
>This is another application for Android, which brings with it an easier way to run a Linux distribution on Android. After using the app, I noticed an interesting option to host an application instead of a virtual machine. Since the Android app itself is a graphical interface, with command-line magic behind the scenes, this provides an excellent learning opportunities ( which should prove extremely helpful for this project).

For those of us who thrive for the nitty-gritty details, I felt the following article by **Mishaal Rahman** is perfect to share with you, as it covers the behind-the-scenes details of virtualization on Android 13 : 

>[How the Android 13 Virtualization Module Uses pKVM to Boot Virtual Machines (esper.io)](https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-5-virtualization-in-android-13-351789)


What I have noticed about the two applications is their use of [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/), which is an **Android Terminal Emulator**. This is the playground on Android for those who have a fondness of learning how things work behind the scenesðŸ˜‰! With **UserLand**, the application asks the user to choose their Linux distribution, the Graphical User Interface, and afterwards, the application offers to copy a command, and to paste it in the **Termux Android Terminal Emulator**! I appreciate all the work that went into these projects, and I wanted to express my gratitude for the creators of these applications!


## The Cluster


Since this idea stems of the shared computing power from all the participants in the organization, we would have to come up with different options to make the **Cluster** a reality. After a lot of research, I thought the following options are available to do so : 


>
>##### 1. Docker's Swarm Mode 
>
>> [!summary] 
>  
>  Docker's **Swarm Mode** basically manages a group of Docker-running computers, where the administrator would indicate the desired state of the containers, and then Docker's Swarm Mode would maintain the desired state. 
>
>>[!pros]
>>
>>1. Docker is widely used by developers and other users across the tech-industry!
>>2. Due to Docker's popularity, we have tons of resources online in case we run into challenges    
>
>
>>[!cons]
>>
>>Docker is quite vulnerable to **Container Escape**, which involves the attacker being able to escape the confines of the container.  For more information on this vulnerability, please check out the following page :

Let us proceed to [[Writers' Guild]], so we can see a manifestation of **Open Corporation**!
