The core element of this corporation is the **Blockchain**. We hear of it whenever we hear of Cryptocurrencies, and it is the world that Cryptocurrencies live in. It is an open ledger that is available for all of us to see. It is secure by-design and decentralized by nature!


What sort of role would the **Blockchain** play in this corporation ? 


#### Blockchain-Based Voting System


Since this corporation is democratic by nature, the idea is to provide each participant a voting token for each hour worked on their projects, for OpenCorporation itself, or by participating in their learning journey. This way, we incentivize learning, and we encourage each other to accomplish what we desire to accomplish, and manifesting our inner visions into this physical reality!



#### Non-Fungible Token Market



The creator's work would be presented on the corporation's market for entities interested in acquiring the rights to the creative endeavor in the form of a filed patent by a legal practitioner located in the same country where the creator is based. The market would allow interested parties in bidding in an auction for the rights to the creative work by bidding on the patent. In terms of the *Writer's Guild*, it would be formulated as a cyber-publishing house, or a literary auction or however we all decide! The challenge is to make this process *intuitive* , *reliable*, *dependable* and *joyful*! 

I believe it would be imperative to invite participation of interested parties by making the purchasing process as easy as possible, without having to deal with the complications of the usual currency-to-cryptocurrency dilemmas. The notion here is :

Our desire for abundant riches would help us in helping each other and this wonderful planet!



#### Smart Contracts' Utilization


Another wonderful feature that certain cryptocurrencies and their blockchains provide us is *Smart Contracts*, which are actions that take place when certain conditions are met. The way I see this feature being utilized by Open Corporation is through the **voting process**, **charitable donations**, and the **division of earnings between the creators**. The division of earnings would happen automatically! 


#### Tokenization


I see them as an integral part in insuring fairness to all those involved. Tokenization would be used in the **voting process**, **time-keeping (to insure fair division of earnings)**, and **support tokens (which would be a token issued for the project itself, in which the public audience can support the creator by purchasing their project's token).
