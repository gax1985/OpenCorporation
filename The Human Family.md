We as human beings strive to better ourselves, and undergo the evolutionary change that comes from walking our paths. Those of us with a keen interest on the stock market are accustomed to examining a corporation's performance in connection to new products, market developments, current state of world events and so on. Yet, we do not hear of the truest asset to any organization. I believe that the human family's wellbeing is being pushed aside all for the sake of profit. I believe that the wellbeing and happiness of a corporation's workers should be the top priority, and profits should be second. 



#### Is this *realistic* ?


I think it is!


When you have an organization that thinks of their staff's wellbeing at all times, we will find that productivity will improve, and profits will soar ( as long as all the internal and external aspects that affect profits are in harmony). 



#### How do we achieve that ?



##### ... with Fairness! 


When we are being treated fairly, it would do wonders to our mental well-being. It would spread to others akin to a ripple-effect. We would be more likely to treat others with fairness as well, as we would know first-hand how it would feel. 


I believe that **OpenCorporation** should treat every member of its human family as a *partner*!


Personally, I have come across workers who worked in a café locally in my city. When they described the structure of this café, I was amazed to hear that the owner of this café offered every worker an equal share of the profits, as long as they worked there. I inquired about the availability of employment at this business venture, and I was not surprised to hear that the turnover rate is non-existent. The café's staff simply did not to leave! 


Thus, this brings me to the structure that I have envisioned. Let us begin with a story ✍️ !



###### Once upon a time ...


...  a **Writer**, a **Patent Lawyer**, a **Psychologist** , a **Blockchain Developer** and an **Artificial-Intelligence Developer**  fatefully happened to be in a quaint café. The writer appeared to be quite visibly depressed. Since the café was smaller in size than its more-affluent counterparts, the psychologist heard the frustrated lamentations of the writer, and proceeded to approach the writer. They proceeded to have an interesting conversation : 


**Psychologist:** "Are you feeling alright? please forgive my intrusion, but you appeared to be quite distressed. I was quite concerned, and felt compelled to approach you" 


**Writer:** "I am feeling absolutely beat down by this downward spiral a writer's life. I have written 8 novels thus far, and every novel I have written, I intended on providing the audience with what they are looking for. It seems that every time I have attempted to publish my novels, I have no idea who to approach. I have shared my works with my fellow-more-distinguished writers, who commented that my work is creative, innovative and caters to the audience's tastes ...".


 **Psychologist:** "I am sorry to hear that. It is sadly an all-too-common reality for writers in our times, as there are a large number of writers who get lost on the path to their creative success. Nonetheless, I urge you to not give up the fight".


(... the **Patent Lawyer** approaches ...)

**Patent Lawyer** : "I apologize about disturbing you, but I could not avoid overhearing your conversation. May I offer you my humble services? I am a Patent-Lawyer,  and patents are my bread-and-butter. If you like, I would be happy to produce a patent for your latest novel, and I know my way around the numerous publishing houses in our city!"

( ... the **Writer**'s facial features shifted from sorrowful expression to a slightly-joyful yet weakened smile ...)


**Writer** : "That would be incredible!"


**Psychologist**: "May I also offer you my services? I would be more than happy to aid you on your creative journey 
by psychologically analyzing your characters' personalities, their interactions with the other personalities in your novel and provide you with a different point of view to contrast your own!"


(... The **Writer**'s smile grew wider ... the **Artificial Intelligence Developer** approaches ...)


**Artificial Intelligence Developer**: "... Please forgive my instrusion, but I think I have an idea that could help! Artificial Intelligence is my speciality, and I train *Large Language Models* on a variety of topics, such as Imagery, Creative Writing and Software Development. I can provide you with the means to utilize *Large Language Models* in your creative writing, and to aid me in training my model to aid fellow writers like yourself in improving their writing chops!"


( ... the **Writer** is ecstatic at this point ...)
