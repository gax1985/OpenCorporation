## Introduction 


We as human beings have been living for centuries in a socio-economic reality that we have to adapt to. In our working lives, it is rare to obtain the perfect employment opportunity. 

Why is that so ? it could be that the employer is not appreciative of our efforts or knowledge, the wages may not be fair or adequate to live a comfortable life in the person's respective society, the employment position may impact the individual negatively in an emotional basis, with stress, abusive employers , unsafe work conditions ... 


Need I go on? We are living this reality every where on this beautiful , yet slowly decaying earth. We go through our lives with strength and determination that our actions would aid us in improving our lives, and that the grass is cleaner on the other side... 


This is precisely the reason why I wanted to present you, my dearest fellow human beings, with the following picture: 


An aspiring writer located in a third-world country has been gifted with an idea for their debuit novel, but does not have the technological means (a Computer) to write the novel, nor the guidance on the best way to manifest this idea into our reality. Our friend does not have any connections to editors, publishers or any legal representatives to aid them on their creative journey. Our friend is physically and mentally exhausted, and is barely coping with life's ever-present challenges...
