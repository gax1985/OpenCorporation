I see **tokens** as an integral part in insuring fairness to all those involved. Tokenization would be used in the **voting process**, **time-keeping (to insure fair division of earnings)**, and **support tokens (which would be a token issued for the project itself, in which the public audience can support the creator by purchasing their project's token).  



##### Why use *Tokens* ? 



The way our economic lives work is through the avenues of paid labour. Since Currency has been a feature in our human existance, it always went through many stages of development. Yet, the premise remains :

 
 Individuals exchanged goods and services among each other based on the mutual agreement concerning the currency being utilized in the payment process as holding *worth*.  

Along with the presence of currencies came along the **Treasury**. Since commercial exchange is a critical part in our survival, we had to come up with ways as human beings to protect our investments and our items of worth (currencies included). The Treasury is a testimony of the importance of material wealth : human beings have to come up with innovative ways to protect their means of survival. 


Yet, we all know that the fortunes of all human beings ( and all living beings in this notion) are prone to sudden change. We see it in the devaluation of currency in wartime economies, as a country's ability to exchange goods and services during wartime is severely hampered.  This leads to another state of existance, where the very notion of currencies holding worth gets shaken to the core. We do not have to imagine what happens in this situation. Those who in the days of yesterdays past felt protected by their financial savings and investments suddenly wake up to a cold reality :  the very currency everyone has trusted in that country suddenly lost confidence, and its worth dwindles every day like a setting sun. 



I did not mean to plunge you into the depths of depression, dearest reader, by mentioning this fact. I understand that you may be wondering where I am going with this, and to that I answer : 


I believe that the the truest currency of worth that we have on this earthly realm is our **time on earth**. We chose certain commodities across the centuries to hold value based on their *finite quality*. Gold, Silver and other elements of worth on the periodic table can withstand financial storms, and carry us across to financial salvation. 


Our time on earth is *finite* by nature. Each of us walks through their respective journey knowing that every moment we live is a series of inter-connected, diminishing moments. This acts as a motivator to many to make their time on earth worthwhile. The act of creativity carves our signature unto this beautiful and chaotic world. We *want*, *desire* and *need* to be **remembered**.


So, dearest reader, this brings us to the point :


When our lives demand of us to do something in terms of labor to aid our families and loved-ones, would a salary-based career be as *just* as a per-hour wage labor?


I support the notion that workers are more likely to be forced to go through their days with the possibility of extra work arriving on their shores at a moment's notice. Ofcourse, there are many exceptions, but what concerns me is the state of the majority of us. Work-life balance suffers even more, as it takes the back seat in the face of this idea living in our subconscious minds.  


Yet, to compare ,those who earn an hourly wage have a feature that decreases the likelihood of this happening : **Overtime Pay**! 

The employer is less likely, in ordinary circumstances, to doll out overtime pay unless absolutely necessary, as profits must be maximized at any costs!
