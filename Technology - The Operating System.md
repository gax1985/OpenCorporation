Please permit me to use the **Writer's Guild** as a model for demonstation purposes :



#### The User Experience 


The operating system itself would host the writer's editor, and would act as a hypervisor in itself. It would enable the writer to write this work of art, and at the same time providing the computing power for other writers to write, and aspiring writers to learn the craft. The way this could be done is with creating a **Docker Cluster** or a **Kubernetes Cluster**. The operating system that the user actually interacts with would contained in a **Docker Container**!

This formula provides the element of *layering*, in which we would strive to insure everyone's utmost security, and practice effective utilization of computing resources (to cut down on the damage that is done every day to our beautiful planet : ). 

So , to simplify : 


The *hypervisor* would run *Docker Containers* which contain the *graphical user interface* that the writer would use to create their work of art!


I have done a lot of research in my aim to find a graphical user interface that is fun to use and light on resources, and I found that the **Linux-based Window Managers** fit the bill, as they are extremely light-weight and *endlessly customizable* ( which would be our bread and butter!)




So to demonstrate : 



##### Hyprland 


I have found the following screenshots on Hyprland's website ([Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)), in which the makers hosted *ricing contests (it refers to the Art of Customizing Window Managers)* :

#### The Operating System (*which runs the User Interface*)



I am really excited to recommend a Linux distribution that is truly mindblowing in its potential, where one can configure the operating system from one file ( or more if more complexity/resourcefulness is desired), save the configuration file, and then install the operating system on another machine and re-create the user experience that they normally use while retaining all the desired applications! 


It helps a *ton* to be able to restore to a previous generation if disaster strikes! Thankfully, NixOS does!


Due to its highly-configurable nature, we can create configurations for operating systems used by the different *guilds*, in which we would work with the creators directly to come up with the best configuration possible for them. Configuration files can be edited as needed, and the changes would be pushed to the desired container on a routine basis. 


# The Writer's Guild 


As a writer, I plan to write my novel in the **Writer's Guild**. I thought I should recommend some additions to the user interface to aid the creative journey : 


## The Writer's Assistant


I would be greeted by the Local Large Language Model, which would be scripted to greet the writer, and ask them probing questions about their written work of art ( akin to the [[[How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method (advancedfictionwriting.com)](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/)|Snowflake Method]], which I found to be very helpful). So, since I am writing a work of fiction, I would write a brief description of the plot to my *Writing Assistant*, in which it would collect written works from legally-available sources online (such as [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  ) that share similarities to the characters in the writer's novel. I thought this would help in dealing with *Writer's Block*, as the writer could chat with the *Writing Assistant* about the current situation of the character, and how similar characters from other works acted in a certain situation for example. The *Writer's Assistant* would be trained on legally-available books that are aimed for creative writing methodologies to play the role of a coach that would provide insights about the work so far. 

When we proceed to the act of writing, I would have **the editor** in central part of the interface, surrounded by additions that would be available for the writer to choose from, such as a *vocabulary guide* (to prevent over-usage of certain works, and to provide fitting recommendations based on the content written already by the writer ). I would provide additions that would provide the writer with insights, such as *The World's Current Mood* ( which involves using data from Google Analytics to see the most common search terms, and rate them in terms of overall positivity), *Image Gallery* (to invigorate one's imagination), and *Fictional/Non-Fictional World Atlas*, in which the writer can plot out the character's journey in the novel, or in non-fiction in plotting out the journey of the individual. 


The *Writing Assistant* would also offer scheduling assistance, in terms of drafting a customized schedule according to the writer's needs. This is done in order to facilitate an ongoing writing practice, and to encourage creativity. It would make the reward of accomplishment even sweeter!


The *Writing Assistant* itself would be an Open-Source Large Language Model that can be used commercially. They are currently available, free to use, and completely offline! 


The idea is to have the **User Interface** which the writer uses to be completely offline! This is done for a variety of reasons, such as increased security and the encouragement of focus. 


After I have completed a very productive writing session, the **Operating System** would record the total time spent on writing, and then issue a command to the **Hypervisor** to issue the tokens for the **Time Worked** on the project, and a **voting token** for each hour of work. The token would have *granularity* as a feature to promote flexibility!


### The Artificial Intelligence and the **Writer's Assistant** 



I know the world has taken to Artificial Intelligence in a huge way. For a long time now, Artificial Intelligence has captured the imagination of us all, either for its absolute sheer potential as a creative entity and  for its comprehension abilities. There has been news recently of a lawsuit filed against **OpenAI**, which is the same entity that produced the beloved *ChatGPT 4.0* for the paying masses, and *ChatGPT 3.5* for us all. Every user that has been tempted by the sheer prowess of this intelligence would get greeted with a message that lets us know that the information that we include with our inquiries would be integrated within its massive collection of data, due to it being in continuous learning mode. This is a massive vulnerability when it comes to our privacy.


To answer this, I pondered multiple strategies , such as : 


#### 1. Utilizing *ChatGPT 4.0*  as the **Writer's Assistant**


>[!pros]
>
>1. It is quite exceptional in its creative strength!
>2. It is incredibly intelligent

>[!cons]
>
>1. Privacy is tremendously affected!
>2. The [[[New York Times Sues OpenAI and Microsoft Over Use of Copyrighted Work - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html)|lawsuit]] against OpenAI on the basis of **copyright infringement** presents a potential risk for OpenCorporation
>3. Since it is a paid service, then that increases the actual fiscal costs for OpenCorporation. A potential source of revenue to cover for this service could potentially be *Ethereum Staking*, which would involve having a pool of 32 Ethereum coins to be used in the verification of Ethereum-based transactions. Another potential source is to create a Cryptocurrency-Trading bot in order to cover the costs of ChatGPT, although these measures mean potential risk for the organization (if an error causes OpenCorporation to lose its ability to fund the ChatGPT 4.0 subscription fees, and this is the sole working model, then it would mean the end of any activities involving Artificial Intelligence for the organization)


#### 2. Utilizing *Local Offline-based Open Source Artificial Intelligence Models* as the **Writer's Assistant**


>[!pros]
>
>1. Internet connectivity is not needed! A lot of members of our human family live without this amenity
>2. There is an abundance of free Open-Source Large Language Models that can be used commercially!


>[!cons]
>
>1. The free Open-Source Large Language Models tend to produce responses that may be not as impressive as ChatGPT 4.0 ( although, in terms of quality of responses, it is very close to ChatGPT 3.5's quality).

 
###### The Plan :

1. The **Operating System** would download the **Large Language Model** from [[[Hugging Face â€“ The AI community building the future.](https://huggingface.co/)|HuggingFace.com]], in accordance to the current ranking of the model of choice ( and its suitability for the task).
2. The model would be trained on the freely-sourced books that would be most useful to the writer by using [[[nomic-ai/gpt4all: gpt4all: run open-source LLMs anywhere (github.com)](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)| GPT4ALL]], which is made by [[[Nomic AI](https://home.nomic.ai/)|Nomic.AI]] as a graphical interface for interacting with Large Language Models. It has a wonderful feature of being able to be trained on a large variety of file formats : 
   
   
4. Afterwards, the model would be ready for use!
