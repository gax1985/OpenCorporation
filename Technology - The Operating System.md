Please permit me to use the **Writer's Guild** as a model for demonstation purposes :



#### The User Experience 


The operating system itself would host the writer's editor, and would act as a hypervisor in itself. It would enable the writer to write this work of art, and at the same time providing the computing power for other writers to write, and aspiring writers to learn the craft. The way this could be done is with creating a **Docker Cluster** or a **Kubernetes Cluster**. The operating system that the user actually interacts with would contained in a **Docker Container**!

This formula provides the element of *layering*, in which we would strive to insure everyone's utmost security, and practice effective utilization of computing resources (to cut down on the damage that is done every day to our beautiful planet : ). 

So , to simplify : 


The *hypervisor* would run *Docker Containers* which contain the *graphical user interface* that the writer would use to create their work of art!


I have done a lot of research in my aim to find a graphical user interface that is fun to use and light on resources, and I found that the **Linux-based Window Managers** fit the bill, as they are extremely light-weight and *endlessly customizable* ( which would be our bread and butter!)




So to demonstrate : 



##### Hyprland 


I have found the following screenshots on Hyprland's website ([Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)), in which the makers hosted *ricing contests (it refers to the Art of Customizing Window Managers)* :

#### The Operating System (*which runs the User Interface*)



I am really excited to recommend a Linux distribution that is truly mindblowing in its potential, where one can configure the operating system from one file ( or more if more complexity/resourcefulness is desired), save the configuration file, and then install the operating system on another machine and re-create the user experience that they normally use while retaining all the desired applications! 


It helps a *ton* to be able to restore to a previous generation if disaster strikes! Thankfully, NixOS does!


Due to its highly-configurable nature, we can create configurations for operating systems used by the different *guilds*, in which we would work with the creators directly to come up with the best configuration possible for them. Configuration files can be edited as needed, and the changes would be pushed to the desired container on a routine basis. 


As a writer, I plan to write my novel in the **Writer's Guild**. I thought I should recommend some additions to the user interface to aid the creative journey :
