Please permit me to use the **Writer's Guild** as a model for demonstation purposes :



#### The User Experience 


The operating system itself would host the writer's editor, and would act as a hypervisor in itself. It would enable the writer to write this work of art, and at the same time providing the computing power for other writers to write, and aspiring writers to learn the craft. The way this could be done is with creating a **Docker Cluster** or a **Kubernetes Cluster**. The operating system that the user actually interacts with would contained in a **Docker Container**!

This formula provides the element of *layering*, in which we would strive to insure everyone's utmost security, and practice effective utilization of computing resources (to cut down on the damage that is done every day to our beautiful planet : ). 

So , to simplify : 


The *hypervisor* would run *Docker Containers* which contain the *graphical user interface* that the writer would use to create their work of art!


I have done a lot of research in my aim to find a graphical user interface that is fun to use and light on resources, and I found that the **Linux-based Window Managers** fit the bill, as they are extremely light-weight and *endlessly customizable* ( which would be our bread and butter!)




So to demonstrate : 



##### Hyprland 


I have found the following screenshots on Hyprland's website ([Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)), in which the makers hosted *ricing contests (it refers to the Art of Customizing Window Managers)* :

#### The Operating System (*which runs the User Interface*)



I am really excited to recommend a Linux distribution that is truly mindblowing in its potential, where one can configure the operating system from one file ( or more if more complexity/resourcefulness is desired), save the configuration file, and then install the operating system on another machine and re-create the user experience that they normally use while retaining all the desired applications! 


It helps a *ton* to be able to restore to a previous generation if disaster strikes! Thankfully, NixOS does!


Due to its highly-configurable nature, we can create configurations for operating systems used by the different *guilds*, in which we would work with the creators directly to come up with the best configuration possible for them. Configuration files can be edited as needed, and the changes would be pushed to the desired container on a routine basis. 


As a writer, I plan to write my novel in the **Writer's Guild**. I thought I should recommend some additions to the user interface to aid the creative journey : 

I would be greated by the Local Large Language Model, which would be scripted to greet the writer, and ask them probing questions about their written work of art ( akin to the [[[How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method (advancedfictionwriting.com)](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/)|Snowflake Method]], which I found to be very helpful). So, since I am writing a work of fiction, I would write a brief description of the plot to my *Writing Assistant*, in which it would collect written works from legally-available sources online (such as [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)  ) that share similarities to the characters in the writer's novel. I thought this would help in dealing with *Writer's Block*, as the writer could chat with the *Writing Assistant* about the current situation of the character, and how similar characters from other works acted in a certain situation for example. The *Writer's Assistant* would be trained on legally-available books that are aimed for creative writing methodologies to play the role of a coach that would provide insights about the work so far. 

When we proceed to the act of writing, I would have **the editor** in central part of the interface, surrounded by additions that would be available for the writer to choose from, such as a *vocabulary guide* (to prevent over-usage of certain works, and to provide fitting recommendations based on the content written already by the writer ). I would provide additions that would provide the writer with insights, such as *The World's Current Mood* ( which involves using data from Google Analytics to see the most common search terms, and rate them in terms of overall positivity), *Image Gallery* (to invigorate one's imagination), and *Fictional/Non-Fictional World Atlas*, in which the writer can plot out the character's journey in the novel, or in non-fiction in plotting out the journey of the individual. 


The *Writing Assistant* would also offer scheduling assistance, in terms of drafting a customized schedule according to the writer's needs. This is done in order to facilitate an ongoing writing practice, and to encourage creativity. It would make the reward of accomplishment even sweeter!


The *Writing Assistant* itself would be an Open-Source Large Language Model that can be used commercially. They are currently available, free to use, and completely offline! 


The idea is to have the **User Interface** which the writer uses to be completely offline! This is done for a variety of reasons, such as increased security and the encouragement of focus. 


After I have completed a very productive writing session, the **Operating System** would record the total time spent on writing, and then issue a command to the **Hypervisor** to issue the tokens for the **Time Worked** on the project, and a **voting token** for each hour of work. The token would have *granularity* as a feature to promote flexibility!
