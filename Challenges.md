# Challenges



In terms of challenges,  let us list them into categories : 



1. Transparency : Organizations are not transparent by nature. Corporations work on their products, and they understandably wish to protect their research and investments.
2. Economical concerns, such as distribution of wages, technological costs , etc ...
3. Creators' rights and privileges, such as protection against exploitation, creating a reliable and dependable Creator-based economy
4. Communications : how could we assure reliable means of communications that is secure by design?
5. Environmental concerns : how can we minimize our damage to this beautiful world? how can we heal ourselves and heal this planet?
6. Technological concerns : how can we accomplish this technologically-speaking, all while keeping the costs to an absolute minimum ?
7. Governance : this organization is democratic by design. How can we make sure it remains so? how can we provide each other with a transparent voting system? 
8. Hierarchy : How can we treat each other with respect and compassion, all while avoiding ego and the notion of classes?
9. Education : How can we provide each other with a learning experience that does not impact us financially whatsoever? How can we aid each other in our learning journeys in the best way possible? 
10. Ethics : How can we make sure that our rights are protected, and to avoid impacting the rights of others? 




As with any concept, issues are naturally expected to arise. It is realistic to accept that reality, and to tackle them head-on. Thus, I forsee the following to-do list : 


1. Be transparent! 
2. Be fair and just!
3. Be kind to this earth!
4. Care for each other!
5. Rule ourselves!
6. Protect each other's rights!
7. Learn from each other!
8. Shine!



Let us proceed with how we can make this vision a *reality*!
